Data Type
	There are four data types to choose from, to accomodate just about anything you'd like to track. 
	
	Event:
		The simplest sort of data, useful mostly for tracking things that happen one at a time. For example, you could use it to track how many cups of coffee you drink, how many cigarettes you smoke, or how often you floss.

	Amount:
		The catchall data type. If you want to track your weight, how much you can benchpress, your tetris score, or how much money you spend on stamps- this is the go-to data type.

	Duration:
		A special-case of 'amount', with a more intuitive input widget and smarter axis labelling. If you want to record your sprint times, or how long you meditate for, this is the type to pick.

	Range:
		Any data that fits into a known range should use this. If you're tracking your grades, any kind of a percentage, movie ratings in stars, or some kind of subjective measure like "happiness on a scale from 1 to 10", you want a range.

	You can change the data type at any time, but you can't transform data from one type to another. When you change the type, entries of the previous type will disappear. This does not destroy you data! If you change back, your old entries will still be there.


Grouping
	Entries can be gathered together into buckets of time. Grouping determines the bucket size. Suppose you were tracking how many cups of coffee you drink per day- the grouping is the "per day". If you want to track cups per week instead, this is the setting you'll change.

	Note that if you're tracking Events, you cannot choose 'No Grouping'.


Group operation
	All the ways to use the grouped data. Total will cause the graph to report the 'total' entries in each group

	Note that if you're tracking Events or have chosen 'No Grouping', the Average, Minimum, and Maximum options are disabled.

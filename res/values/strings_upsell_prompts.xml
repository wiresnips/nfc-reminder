			Ahoy! |
			Just popping by to see how things are going. Everything\'s on track, I hope?\n\nRemember that you can upgrade to premium any time you like. It\'ll help support further development, and you\'ll disable the banner ads (and also these popups).

			How\'s it going? | 
			I hope Track &amp; Graph is working out well for you.\n\nIf you\'re getting good use from it, maybe premium is the thing for you- kill the banner ads and support further development in one fell swoop!

			Keep it up |
			Wow, you\'re really getting some mileage out of Track &amp; Graph. Awesome!\n\nIf you ever want to get a little more from it, consider bumping up to premium. It strips out the ads, and I\'ll never bother you with these popups again!.
